## Reflection Questions

1. **Explain dynamic programming to someone who has never programmed.**
   - Imagine solving a complex problem by breaking it down into smaller, simpler pieces. You will then solve those smaller, simpler pieces and write down the answer before moving onto the next problem. Then, the next time you see that problem again, you will already have the answer written down somewhere. Dynamic programming is essentially that same exact process, where you solve a smaller subproblem and remember that answer, and then build the final solution to that complex problem out of those remembered answers instead of redoing the same work over and over.

2. **What has to be true about a problem for the grid to work at all?**
   - Two things must be true about a problem for the grid to work. Firstly, the problem needs to have overlapping subproblems. The same smaller problem must repeatedly come up while solving the bigger one, otherwise, there is no point in remembering that answer. Secondly, it needs to have an optimal substructure, the best answer to the complex larger problem needs to be able to be pulled from the smaller subproblems.

3. **Where does this show up in real software?**
   - In a function like `git diff`, figuring out the minimal set of line changes between two file versions is a classic situation where dynamic programming is optimal. You subdivide the problem in to smaller subproblems and solve the smaller problem and save the answer for later. You will then solve the large problem by reusing the answers you already have to ultimately reach the cheapest way to transform the first i lines into the first j lines.
